# Feedfilter
News sites, such as Google News, have content that is updated on an unpredictable schedule. One tedious way to keep track of this changing content is to load the website up in the browser and periodically hit the refresh button. This process can be streamlined and automated by connecting to the website's RSS. An RSS feed consists of (periodically changing) data stored in an XML-format file residing on a web-server. With the help of  feedparser library, built a feed filter which would give all the news published on google about the trigger word in the set amount of time.
